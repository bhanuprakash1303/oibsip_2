          <h2>Apple Founder</h2>
          <p>
            Steven Paul Jobs was an American entrepreneur, businessman,
            inventor, and industrial designer. He was the chairman, and the
            chief executive officer (CEO), and a co-founder of Apple Inc.; CEO
            and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney
            Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and
            founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs and Apple co-founder Steve
            Wozniak are widely recognized as pioneers of the microcomputer
            revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.Jobs was born in San Francisco to
            parents who had to put him up for adoption at birth; he was raised
            in the San Francisco Bay Area during the 1960s. Jobs briefly
            attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out. He then decided
            to travel through India in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying
            Zen Buddhism. Jobs's declassified FBI report stated that an
            acquaintance knew that Jobs had used the illegal drugs marijuana and
            LSD while he was in college. Jobs once told a reporter that taking
            LSD was "one of the two or three most important things" he did in
            his life.

              Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water,
              or do you want a chance to change the world? [Jobs inviting an

              In my perspective... science and computer science is a liberal
              art. It’s something everyone should know how to use, at least, and
              harness in their life.

              It’s in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough. It’s
              technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities
              that yields us the result that makes our hearts sing.

              There’s an old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love—‘I skate to where
              the puck is going to be, not where it has been’—and we’ve always
              tried to do that at Apple.
